## Introduction

Welcome to **nvimDev** – a sleek, fast, and highly customizable Neovim distribution built by me,
</br>
**Priyanshu Ranjan**, final-year student at **IIT Kharagpur**. 🌟

This project started as a quest for the **perfect code editor**. While many Neovim distros exist, none had the **set of plugins or keybindings** I wanted(ofc this is not possible), nor did they offer a code structure that was simple to configure and understand. So, I decided to build one myself! 🚀

### Why **nvimDev**?

Most Neovim distros are either **too bloated** or **hard to customize**. The code structure is often complex, making it difficult for users to add their own configurations. That’s where **nvimDev** shines – it’s built to be:

- 🔥 **Lightweight** – Takes minimal space and RAM.
- ⚡ **Fast** – With lazy loading, your experience remains **buttery smooth**, no matter how many plugins you use.
- 🎨 **Aesthetic** – Get a beautiful UI experience right out of the box.
- 🖱️ **User-Friendly** – Simplified keybindings that make navigation feel like second nature.
- 🛠️ **Easy to Customize** – The code structure is neat, with separate folders for plugin configurations and core settings. Make it **your own** with just a few tweaks!

Whether you’re an **experienced Neovim user** or just a **beginner** looking for a powerful code editor, **nvimDev** is made for you! The learning curve is smooth and once you get the hang of it, it’ll feel like home. 🏡

Stay tuned for frequent updates as this project is still under development. 🌱 And yes, it’s **free and open-source**, written in Lua, and runs smoothly on any Unix system. Fast and Easy Installation. Use it anytime anywhere.
