## ✨ Introduction

Welcome to **nvimDev** – a sleek, fast, and highly customizable Neovim distribution built by me,
</br>
**Priyanshu Ranjan**, final-year student at **IIT Kharagpur**. 🌟

This project started as a quest for the **perfect code editor**. While many Neovim distros exist, none had the **set of plugins or keybindings** I wanted(ofc this is not possible), nor did they offer a code structure that was simple to configure and understand. So, I decided to build one myself! 🚀

### Why **nvimDev**?

Most Neovim distros are either **too bloated** or **hard to customize**. The code structure is often complex, making it difficult for users to add their own configurations. That’s where **nvimDev** shines – it’s built to be:

- 🔥 **Lightweight** – Takes minimal space and RAM.
- ⚡ **Fast** – With lazy loading, your experience remains **buttery smooth**, no matter how many plugins you use.
- 🎨 **Aesthetic** – Get a beautiful UI experience right out of the box.
- 🖱️ **User-Friendly** – Simplified keybindings that make navigation feel like second nature.
- 🛠️ **Easy to Customize** – The code structure is neat, with separate folders for plugin configurations and core settings. Make it **your own** with just a few tweaks!

Whether you’re an **experienced Neovim user** or just a **beginner** looking for a powerful code editor, **nvimDev** is made for you! The learning curve may be steep, but trust me, once you get the hang of it, it’ll feel like home. 🏡

Stay tuned for frequent updates as this project is still under development. 🌱 And yes, it’s **free and open-source**, written in Lua, and runs smoothly on any Unix system. Fast and Easy Installation. Use it anytime nanywhere.

## ⚡ Requirements

What you need to have?

- OS - Linux/MacOS/WSL
- [Neovim 0.10.0+, built with LuaJIT](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases/tag/stable)
- A [Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads) (Optional)
- A terminal with true color support (Optional)

---

## 🛠️ Installation

### Backup your Existing Configuration

At first, backup your existing neovim configuration
</br>
Follow the below commands to backup:

```sh
mv ~/.config/nvim{,.bak}

# optional but recommended
mv ~/.local/share/nvim{,.bak}
mv ~/.local/state/nvim{,.bak}
mv ~/.cache/nvim{,.bak}
```

</br>
If you don't have one or don't care about it, just forget it
</br>
</br>
Mastering manual processes is essential for any programmer!
</br>
So, let's take the time to clone the repository manually(it's easy)

### Clone (Linux/MacOS/WSL)

- Follow one of the following commands. Either one is fine.

```sh
# Directly clone the repository to the ~/.config/nvim folder
git clone https://github.com/prrockzed/nvimDev.git ~/.config/nvim
```

<p align="center">OR</p>

```sh
# Clone the repository and symlink it with your ~/.config/nvim folder
git clone https://github.com/prrockzed/nvimDev.git

# Replace the ~/path/to/nvimDev with your own path
ln -s ~/path/to/nvimDev ~/.config/nvim
```

- Now delete the .git folder to enable adding this to your own repository later

```sh
rm -rf ~/.config/nvim/.git
```

### Downloading from Releases

Like a specific release? Download from previous releases

- Go to the releases part in the about section
